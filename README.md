# stream-deck-plugins-requests
This repo is used for new Stream Deck plugins that I would like built by the community.
I will be funding these requests with funds escrowed on the Pomelo Bounty platform.
Anyone is free to apply to complete these bounties and get paid. See issue comments for more details.
